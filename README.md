## Introduction

Skeletal muscle imaging is a critical area of research with numerous applications in medical diagnostics, sports science, and rehabilitation. 

This repository aims to gather and document pipelines relating to skeletal muscle imaging, particularly those that operate within FIJI and ImageJ.

Specific requirements to be referenced here are:
1) Pipeline is in the form of a macro, script, or ImageJ/FIJI plugin
2) Operates within the FIJI/ImageJ environment

Specific requirements to be distributed here are:
1) Software is licensed appropriately
2) Software is open-source

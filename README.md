## Introduction

This resource serves to gather, distribute, and document pipelines relating to skeletal muscle imaging, particularly those that operate within FIJI and ImageJ.

Software referenced here must:
1) Provide functionality for skeletal muscle imaging
2) Be in the form of a macro, script, or ImageJ/FIJI plugin
3) Operate within the FIJI/ImageJ environment
4) Be publically accessible.

Software distributed here must
1) Software is licensed appropriately
2) Software is open-source
